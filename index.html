            <h1>Welcome to Young PT</h1>
            <p>My name is Lauren Young and I'm a Personal Trainer covering the City of London and surrounding areas. As a personal trainer I take an holistic approach to working with motivated clients and achieve great results.
               My clients will tell you that improved fitness, weight loss and great body shape are achievable through a combination of my training techniques, lifestyle advice and your commitment. Life is busy, personal training with me can help you prioritise your health and wellbeing and put you on track to enjoying life to the full.
               Personal training is the safest and quickest way to achieve maximum results in the minimum amount of time. Whether you want to lose weight, tone up, improve general fitness or train for a specific event, I will design and develop a unique fitness programme suited to your needs and goals.</p>

        <!--about me-->
        <section class="main index_h2">
            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Initially I trained as a dancer but due to injury I was unable to pursue this career. I became involved in dance and sport medicine, which led me to training with the YMCA. 
               Since then, I have worked as a trainer in various gyms and began offering personal training sessions in 2001.
               I now concentrate on personal training, which is the most rewarding aspect for me. I have numerous training sessions with clients of all ages and fitness levels.
               With continuous professional development a priority, I continue to attend training courses, events, seminars and conferences to keep up with the latest developments in the health and fitness industry.
               I hold an Instructor Level 3 membership with the Register of Exercise Professionals, which means my qualifications have been verified and that I have public liability insurance, an important factor to consider when choosing a personal trainer. 
               I am also a trained first aider.
