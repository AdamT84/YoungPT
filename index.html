            <p>My name is Lauren Young and I'm a Personal Trainer. As a personal trainer I take an holistic approach to working with motivated clients and achieve great results.
                My clients will tell you that improved fitness, weight loss and great body shape are achievable through a combination of my training techniques, lifestyle advice and your commitment.</p>

            <p>I hold an Instructor Level 3 membership with the Register of Exercise Professionals. This means my qualifications have been verified and that I have public liability insurance, an important factor to consider when choosing a personal trainer.</p>
            
            <p> Life is busy, personal training with me can help you prioritise your health and wellbeing and put you on track to enjoying life to the full.
                Personal training is the safest and quickest way to achieve maximum results in the minimum amount of time.
                Whether you want to lose weight, tone up, improve general fitness or train for a specific event, I will design and develop a unique fitness programme suited to your needs and goals.</p>
